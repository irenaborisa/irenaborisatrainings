### Takeaways:
- Composition is a safer alternative with regards to encapsulation when defining variations and specification in a class.
- Design variations in the behavior of a class by forwarding calls to a delegate object field and use virtual method invocation.
- Composition is more flexible since the delegate object can be determined during run-time.
