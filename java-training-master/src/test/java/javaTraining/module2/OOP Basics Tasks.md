### Create an Animal class. Animal class should have
1. 3 fields - age, size, color (don`t use public access level, nor default) - **Access Level, Instance Variables**
2. Provide interfaces for writing and reading Animal`s class fields. Name of the parameters should be the same as the fields (**Methods, Encapsulation, Getters/Setters**)
3. 3 behaviours - eating, sleeping, making a noise. All 3 should just output corresponding behaviour to console.(**Methods**)
4. Create another behaviour with the same behaviour name as when making a noise, but this time you should set what the output should be. (**Overloading, Method Parameters**)
5. 2 ways of constructing the Animal class - by setting only the age and setting all 3 fields at once. (**Constructors**)
6. Create 2 animal objects constructing those with different constructors. This should be done from a separate file. (**Main Method**)
7. Set all missing fields for the objects
8. Invoke all behaviours


### Questions
- Classes vs. Instances?

### Takeaways
- A class is a template for a specific object.
- A class defines the **attributes** and **methods** that all **objects** belonging to the **class** have.
- The attributes and methods of a class are called **fields** or members.
- An instance refers to an object that is a member of a particular class. All objects that belong to a class are instances of that class.

- Instances of a class can be created by using the `new` keyword.  This process is called **instantiation**.
- The `new` keyword creates the object based on the specified class and returns a reference to the newly created object.
- The reference is then received by an appropriate identifier.
